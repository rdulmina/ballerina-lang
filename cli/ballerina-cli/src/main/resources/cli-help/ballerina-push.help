       2) Add the access token with the registration you receive  to the
          'Settings.toml' file in the home repository (<USER_HOME>/.ballerina/).
       3) Add the created organization name and version to the
          'Ballerina.toml' file in the package directory.

             org= "abc"
             name= "foo"
             version= "1.0.0"
